# Setup

## Setting up a quote channel
A quote channel is a channel where all quotes will be posted. They will also be automatically be refreshed when they 
are edited or removed when deleted.

Use the `/manage quote_channel` command to define the quote channel

Once the channel is defined the bot will start to post all existing quotes to the channel.
